BONES:
addresses showed in ida: 0x15310000 (seems to be the right one!), 0x0096CD68
it seems like every bone has a 3x4 matrix associated, and in particular:
bone_matrix[0][3], bone_matrix[1][3], bone_matrix[2][3] seem to be the 
x,y,z coordinate of each bone
the order of the various bones in unknown, theoretically the one I want
(head bone) is the one with the hightst z coordinate?

candidates: 15310120, 237
		15310510, 240

the actual headbone seems to be located at 0x15310600

the final structure may look something like bonematrices[?]
being a vector, in which each element is 3x4 matrix, so being 12x4 bytes -> 48bytes

so to access the start of the head bone it should be bonemtrices[15] (0x15310600-0x15310000 / 48bytes = 15)

playing with a single bot his (likely to be) bone matrix starts at 0x14EC0020, maybe the bone matrices of the other entities
are stored from this address onwards?`

UPDATE: it seems that only worked for third person? when opening memory viewer AllocationBase and Base point to the start
of one of the matrices it seems?

UPDATE: getting the bone matrix of a bot (i tried going to the AllocationBase address), the head bone is after 140 bytes,
15350140 if the base if 15350000

UPDATE: the start of the matrix of a bot is always (probably) at "materialsystem.dll"+0012FEFC
